## Host a Qualifier

Hosting a tournament has never been easier, but there are a few requirements that an organizer should understand before reaching out:

1. Registration, payment, and match play is all managed through the Darts Atlas platform. Organizers will be sent a link to their tournament homepage once their events have been approved, and will be responsible for checking players in on the day of the event. Check-in consists of clicking an "Approve" button on a player registration management page, accessible through any smart phone or connected tablet.
2. Each board must be equipped with a tablet (7" minimum) that is capable of recording scores on the Darts Atlas website.
3. Host venues must be non-smoking and publicly accessible to all players age 21 and over.
4. Additional entry fees may not be collected. However, organizers are encouraged to run a secondary event on Darts Atlas following the conclusion of their Qualifier, and may employ any format and fee structure they wish.
5. A minimum of 16 players is required for the winner to earn an entry to the Texas Darts Masters
